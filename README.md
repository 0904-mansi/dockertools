Developers love Docker. Docker is a suite of software development tools for creating, sharing and running containers. Developers use Docker to accelerate how they build, share, and run modern applications. This repository was built with a purpose. It is being used by Collabnix community internally to target the most popular developer tools and technique and coming up with the best practices around these tools.
